This is a nostalgic (not only) .sid file player for Raspberry Pi 2/3 written in Pascal/asm. Lazarus 1.4 or newer needed for build this project from the source. Executable binary project1 included. To run executable, unpack the project files in any directory on the Raspberry Pi, do chmod +x project1 and run it from there

To build this from the source when in X, open the project1.lpi with Lazarus and build.
When in command line mode, use make.

Needs SDL 1.2

The project stage: working alpha
